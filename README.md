# TIC — Learning Project for Node, Express, Vue and JavaScript

## Description

This project was created for educational purposes, to learn and experiment with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Vue.js**, and **JavaScript**. It is part of university coursework and aims to provide a small backend + frontend structure for hands-on practice.

## Features

In its current stage, TIC provides:

- Backend server built with **Express.js**
- REST API for resources (located in the `REST/` folder)
- Simple frontend built with **Vue.js**
- Clear project structure separating backend and frontend
- Example routes and Vue components

## Technologies

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js** — web framework for backend APIs
- **Vue.js** — progressive JavaScript framework for the frontend
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **npm / yarn** — package management tools

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandrusurugiu/TIC.git
cd TIC
cd REST
npm install
cd API
node app.js   # the server starts on port 5000
```

## Future Plans / To Do
- Add a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL)
- Implement simple authentication (login / logout)
- Add full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete)
- Input validation on both backend and frontend
- Deploy the project (e.g., on Heroku / Vercel)
- Improve UI styling (e.g., Bootstrap / Vuetify)
